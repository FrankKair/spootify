[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/FrankKair/spootify.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/FrankKair/spootify)

`spootify` fetches information / lyrics about the album / song you're currently listening to.

This utility is **macOS** only since it uses **AppleScript** to get information from Spotify.

### Usage

Download the [binary release](https://github.com/FrankKair/spootify/releases) or clone the repo, run `go get` and `go install` to install the package and then call `spootify` on your terminal. You should see:

### Motivation

I enjoy learning about the context and stories behind the music I listen to.

### Inspiration

[shpotify](https://github.com/hnarayanan/shpotify)'s usage of AppleScript to control the Spotify macOS client made me realize how useful AppleScript can be.
